### Pinned Repositories

1. ##### [Visual Taskboard](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/ResNet-Visual-Taskboard)
- Created because `myself and my co-workers were unhappy with our current issue tracking system` and its lack of integration with our ticketing system
- `Took initiative to start this project on my own` from scratch to increase the work experience (and efficiency!) of the entire office.
- A visual taskboard (Similar to Trello) that integrates with the ServiceNow ticketing API
- Visualizes Client Updated and Stale tickets while allowing custom organization, sorting, and automation.
- Built with Node.js, React, and Express.

2. ##### **Distributed System in Go / Golang** (Repository Coming Soon)
- A `Replicated Key-Value Store Distributed System`
- Made in `Go`
- Replicates data to all available replicas in the system, `automatically detects downed replicas` (and notifies all other replicas of this info)
- `Enforces Causal Consistency` through the use of Causal Meta-data
- Test suite to allow confidence in functionality

3. ##### **Multi-Threaded HTTP Server in C** (Repository Coming Soon)
- `Uses only system calls`, does **NOT** use the stdio library (No fopen, read, etc.) as I wanted to understand the process of what really goes into an HTTP server
- Simple server that stores allows files to be stored and retrieved from the server

4. ##### [SlugMart](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/SlugMart) {Private repository available upon request}
- Full-stack E-commerce app 
- Complete with checkout, administration websites, Vendor API's, Vendor Websites, Checkout/Stripe Integration
- Technologies & Ideas: React, Tailwind, GraphQL, Express, AWS, RESTful API, Docker, Microservices, & More!

5. ##### [Three Bulky Bears](https://github.com/SpaceDoddyssey/ThreeBulkyBears) {Private repository available upon request}
- A platformer game made as a group of ~20
- Published on Steam, created in Unity
- Contributed as a Programmer `(Gameplay programmer, UI Programmer, & Automatic analytic collection)`
- Collaborated with Designers, Investors, Managers, & Artists

7. ##### [Facial-Recognition-TicTacToe](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/Facial-Recognition-TicTacToe)
- Trained a neural network based on a Kaggle dataset.
- User plays TicTacToe by using their facial expression to dictate moves.
- Employs convolution layers, max-pooling layers, dense layers, dropout layers,
  and data augmentation to minimize overfitting to the relatively small data set.
- Done in Python

10. ##### [Time-Defender](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/Time-Defender)
- Created in JavaScript using the Phaser library
- Made with 2 other team members with varying levels of programming and artistic experience.
- Includes procedurally generated video and audio
- `Browser downloads less than 1MB in order to play the game`
- Managed a production timeline which included storyboarding, prototyping, task delegation, and weekly progress reports.
