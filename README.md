### Pinned Repositories

1. ##### [Portfolio](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/Portfolio)
- A website that hosts my portfolio.
- Includes work experience, relevant coursework, and most of my personal projects.
- Built-in HTML and CSS.

2. ##### [Facial-Recognition-TicTacToe](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/Facial-Recognition-TicTacToe)
- Trained a neural network based on a Kaggle dataset.
- User plays TicTacToe by using their facial expression to dictate moves.
- Employs convolution layers, max-pooling layers, dense layers, dropout layers,
  and data augmentation to minimize overfitting to the relatively small data set.
- Done in Python

3. ##### [Disposable-Game](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/Disposable-Game)
- Made with a team of 4 with varying levels of programming and artistic experience.
- Uses the Godot game engine which we were learning alongside the project.
- Managed a production timeline which included storyboarding, prototyping, task delegation, 
and weekly progress reports.
- I was responsible for the UI/UX, Mechanics, Level and Upgrade Design, and Debugging
- The entire project was made in three weeks.

4. ##### [RSA-Encryption-Decryption](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/RSA-Encryption-Decryption)
- C program that encrypts, decrypts, and generates public/private keys using RSA algorithms.
- Generates an SSH key and encryptes/decryptes files using the SSH methods. You may use each of these functions separately or pipe them together!
- I am responsible for creating all the *.c files and makefile
- I am not responsible for the 2 header files.

5. ##### [Time-Defender](https://github.com/Wyatt-Hawes/Time-Defender)
- Created in JavaScript using the Phaser library
- Made with 2 other team members with varying levels of programming and artistic experience.
- Includes procedurally generated video and audio
- Browser downloads less than 1MB in order to play the game
- Managed a production timeline which included storyboarding, prototyping, task delegation, and weekly progress reports.
